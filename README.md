# About me
I'm a software engineer with a strong analytical mindset.
I studied computer science, mathematics, and public law in college.
I have Bachelor's degrees in both and also completed all of the theoretical courses for my Master's in Mathematics and Computer Science.
I have more than 3 years of experience in building desktop and web applications.
Currently, I'm starting to build mobile apps.
